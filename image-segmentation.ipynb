This error can happen for\nmany reasons, often due to issues with your setup or how NumPy was\ninstalled.\n\nWe have compiled some common reasons and troubleshooting tips at:\n\n    https://numpy.org/devdocs/user/troubleshooting-importerror.html\n\nPlease note and check the following:\n\n  * The Python version is: Python3.9 from \"/Users/anudeepragata/miniforge3/envs/tensorflow/bin/python\"\n  * The NumPy version is: \"1.19.5\"\n\nand make sure that they are the versions you expect.\nPlease carefully study the documentation linked above for further help.\n\nOriginal error was: dlopen(/Users/anudeepragata/miniforge3/envs/tensorflow/lib/python3.9/site-packages/numpy/core/_multiarray_umath.cpython-39-darwin.so, 0x0002): Library not loaded: @rpath/libcblas.3.dylib\n  Referenced from: /Users/anudeepragata/miniforge3/envs/tensorflow/lib/python3.9/site-packages/numpy/core/_multiarray_umath.cpython-39-darwin.so\n  Reason: tried: '/Users/anudeepragata/miniforge3/envs/tensorflow/lib/libcblas.3.dylib' (no such file), '/Users/anudeepragata/miniforge3/envs/tensorflow/lib/libcblas.3.dylib' (no such file), '/Users/anudeepragata/miniforge3/envs/tensorflow/lib/python3.9/site-packages/numpy/core/../../../../libcblas.3.dylib' (no such file), '/Users/anudeepragata/miniforge3/envs/tensorflow/lib/libcblas.3.dylib' (no such file), '/Users/anudeepragata/miniforge3/envs/tensorflow/lib/libcblas.3.dylib' (no such file), '/Users/anudeepragata/miniforge3/envs/tensorflow/lib/python3.9/site-packages/numpy/core/../../../../libcblas.3.dylib' (no such file), '/Users/anudeepragata/miniforge3/envs/tensorflow/lib/libcblas.3.dylib' (no such file), '/Users/anudeepragata/miniforge3/envs/tensorflow/bin/../lib/libcblas.3.dylib' (no such file), '/Users/anudeepragata/miniforge3/envs/tensorflow/lib/libcblas.3.dylib' (no such file), '/Users/anudeepragata/miniforge3/envs/tensorflow/bin/../lib/libcblas.3.dylib' (no such file), '/usr/local/lib/libcblas.3.dylib' (no such file), '/usr/lib/libcblas.3.dylib' (no such file)\n"]}],"source":["import warnings\n","warnings.filterwarnings(\"ignore\")\n","\n","import pandas as pd\n","import numpy as np\n","import os\n","import gc\n","import cv2\n","from PIL import Image \n","import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n","from tqdm import tqdm\n","from tqdm.notebook import tqdm\n","from datetime import datetime\n","import json,itertools\n","from typing import Optional\n","from glob import glob\n","\n","from sklearn.model_selection import StratifiedKFold\n","\n","from tensorflow import keras\n","import tensorflow as tf\n","from keras import backend as K\n","from keras.models import Model\n","from keras.layers import Input\n","from keras.layers.convolutional import Conv2D, Conv2DTranspose\n","from keras.layers.pooling import MaxPooling2D\n","from keras.layers.merge import concatenate\n","from keras.losses import binary_crossentropy\n","from keras.callbacks import Callback, ModelCheckpoint\n","from keras.models import load_model\n","\n","import matplotlib.gridspec as gridspec\n","import matplotlib.patches as mpatches\n","import matplotlib as mpl"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["BATCH_SIZE = 16\n","EPOCHS=30\n","n_splits=5\n","fold_selected=1 # 1..5"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":[]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3.9.11 ('tensorflow')","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.9.12"},"vscode":{"interpreter":{"hash":"151080a0a58d4e8f57c2f25c45058f75f43d873993c96dd485aaac22735bb11c"}}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":4}
